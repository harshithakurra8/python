Just like functions we can also add documentation strings to our modules and also access it attributes.

pip - package installer  for python:

In python we have pip package manager.

With pip command we can manage third party package in our system.

#website : pypi.org

This is example we can execute in terminal:

pip --version

python -m pip #work around of pip

pip install Faker

python

>>>import Faker
>>>fake=faker.Faker()
>>>fake.name()

To uninstall
   pip uninstall faker


venv-Virtual Environment :

A project with its specific third party packages installed in it.

To create a virtual environment in python we can use the venv module that is built-in with python.


commands:

python -m venv.\venv  #it can create a virtual directory

Virtual Environments which we use and isolate our project modules and packages so that it is not installecd globally instead.

we just have a environment or certain directory all the packagws used  in the directory is installed.
